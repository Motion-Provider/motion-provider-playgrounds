 * app. That's why I've decided to disable this util fn. In normal cases
 * you will have this util under the hood working in a very normal way.
 *
 * If you're curious about this, basically in playground configuration whenever
 * no animation detected, this was throwing an error in the console which was
 * non-sense. So I decided to disable it as a workaround. Cheers!
